# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.

# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("."))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
release = get_distribution("django-defender").version

# The short X.Y version.
version = ".".join(release.split(".")[:2])

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Explicitly specify the master doc file for Sphinx 1.x
master_doc = "index"

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named "sphinx.ext.*") or your custom
# ones.
extensions = []

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ["_static"]
